EMMANUEL PETERMARTIAL ARTS CURRICULUMMuay Thai Â· Wrestling Foundations Â· The Warrior IdentityWhy Muay Thai FirstGiven your goals â€” aesthetic physique, athletic explosiveness, aura and presence, sport performance â€” Muay Thai is the single most efficient martial art for your specific combination of objectives.Develops the lean explosive physique â€” Muay Thai conditioning burns fat and builds functional muscle simultaneously, never creating unwanted bulk8 weapons â€” punches, elbows, knees, kicks. Your entire body becomes trained, not just your handsHip rotation and footwork transfers directly to football and basketball performanceThe discipline and presence it builds is real and visible â€” people who train Muay Thai carry a different energyMost practical striking system in real situations â€” not sport onlyWrestling basics are added in Month 4 onward. The combination of Muay Thai striking and wrestling fundamentals is the most complete self-defence and athletic martial foundation available without years of specialisation.MONTH 1 â€” STANCE, MOVEMENT, BASIC STRIKES[ Solo Training Â· 15 minutes daily + Saturday 30 minutes ]A beginner who has practised 10,000 jabs once is less dangerous than someone who has practised 1 jab 10,000 times.Week 1â€“2: The FoundationOrthodox Stance â€” Master This FirstEvery technique is built from this position. Do not rush past it.Left foot forward, right foot back â€” feet shoulder-width apart, angled at 45 degreesWeight distribution: 60% on rear foot, 40% on front foot â€” this keeps you mobile and balancedLeft fist at chin height, right fist at cheekbone level â€” elbows protecting your ribsChin slightly tucked â€” this protects your jaw and keeps your head in the strongest positionKnees soft â€” never locked. This allows instant movementStay on the balls of your feet â€” flat feet make you slowDaily drill: Stand in front of a mirror in stance for 2 minutes. Check every point. Adjust until it is automatic.Footwork â€” The Foundation of EverythingStep forward: lead foot moves first, then rear foot follows â€” never cross your feetStep back: rear foot moves first, then lead foot followsStep left: left foot moves firstStep right: right foot moves firstCircle left (away from rear hand): step left foot, pivot, rear foot followsCircle right (into rear hand): step right foot, pivot, lead foot followsDaily drill: 5 minutes of footwork only â€” no punches. Move around your room in stance. Change direction. Stay light. Your basketball footwork is already an advantage here.Week 1â€“2 Techniques â€” Learn These OnlyJab â€” left arm extends straight, fist rotates palm-down at full extension, snaps back immediately. Speed not power.Cross â€” right arm drives forward, right hip rotates forward simultaneously, push off the right foot. This is your power shot.Jab-Cross (1-2) â€” the most fundamental combination in all of striking. Practice this 200 times daily minimum.Week 3â€“4: Adding the KickMuay Thai Roundhouse Kick â€” Your Most Important WeaponThe Muay Thai roundhouse kick is the most powerful and practical kick in martial arts. Your football background gives you the hip rotation it requires.From stance, pivot fully on the ball of your LEFT (front) foot â€” this opens your hipsYour right hip swings forward and around â€” the leg follows the hip, not the other wayContact is made with the SHIN, not the foot â€” the shin is the hardest part of your leg and does not break like the footYour arms swing in the opposite direction for balance and power â€” left arm goes back as right leg comes forwardAfter the kick â€” return to stance immediately. Do not leave your leg extended.Practice: stand next to a wall and practice the pivot and hip swing without kicking. 50 reps each side daily. Feel the hip rotation.Month 1 target: kicks reaching knee height on a stationary target. Hip flexibility from your daily stretching is what raises this ceiling.Teep (Push Kick) â€” Your Range Control WeaponFrom stance â€” lift your front knee straight up toward your chestDrive the heel of your foot straight forward into the targetThis is a range control tool â€” it keeps opponents at distance and disrupts their rhythmNot a power kick â€” a control kick. Light and fast.MONTH 2 â€” COMBINATIONS AND DEFENCE[ Combinations Â· Guard Â· Defensive Movement ]Core Combinations â€” Drill Each 100 Times DailyCombination 1: Jab-Cross-Low Kick (1-2-Leg)The most practical combination in Muay Thai. Punches set up the kick.Jab to draw guard up, cross to follow through, low kick to rear thigh while guard is occupiedThe low kick targets the outside of the rear thigh â€” it does not require flexibility and accumulates damage over a fightRhythm: 1-2 (fast) â€” pause â€” kick (explosive)Combination 2: Teep-Cross-Kick (Push-Cross-Leg)Teep to push opponent back and create space, cross as they return forward, low kick as cross retractsThis combination uses distance control (teep) into power (cross) into damage (kick)Combination 3: Jab-Cross-Left Hook (1-2-3)Left hook: rotate left hip forward, left arm swings in an arc at head level, pivot on left footThe hook is a power shot from the side â€” harder to see than the jab or crossJab opens, cross follows, hook catches them adjusting guardBasic DefenceThe 4 Defensive Tools â€” Month 2Parry â€” use your palm to deflect an incoming jab or cross offline. Right palm parries jab (pushes it to your left). Left palm parries cross.Bob and weave â€” bend knees to lower level and move head offline from a hook. Dip under and come up on the outside.Check â€” lift your shin to block a low kick. Raise front knee, shin angled outward. The two shins collide â€” yours wins because you are prepared.Clinch â€” when very close, grab behind the opponent's neck with both hands, pull their head down, control their posture. From here you use knee strikes.Knee Strike From ClinchFrom clinch position: one hand behind neck, other controlling armDrive rear knee straight up into the midsection or thighsPull the head down as the knee comes up â€” meet in the middle for maximum effectMONTH 3 â€” ADVANCED TECHNIQUES[ Higher Kicks Â· Elbows Â· Flow Development ]High Kick â€” The Flexibility PayoffBy Month 3 your daily flexibility routine will have opened your hips enough to throw kicks above the waist comfortably. This is the payoff of the daily stretching investment.High roundhouse kick: same mechanics as the low kick, but hip rotation is more aggressive and the kick travels a higher arcTarget: temple, neck, or shoulder of the opponentRequires: hip flexor openness (from pigeon pose), hamstring flexibility (from forward fold), and the muscle memory of the basic kickMonth 3 target: kick reaching shoulder height on both sidesElbow StrikesElbows are Muay Thai's most dangerous weapons in close range. They cut and cause immediate visual damage.Horizontal ElbowFrom guard, drive elbow horizontally across at face level â€” same motion as a hook but with the elbow instead of the fistShort range weapon â€” only effective when closeDiagonal Elbow (12-6)Drive elbow downward at 45 degrees â€” used after a catch or when opponent lowers their headMost cutting of all elbow variationsShadowboxing FlowBy Month 3 your shadowboxing should look and feel fluid â€” not mechanical. Each round should tell a story: create distance, close distance, attack, defend, clinch, break.Round structure: open with footwork only (30 seconds), then jabs to establish range (30 seconds), then full combinations (90 seconds), then clinch simulation (30 seconds)Visualise an actual opponent at all times â€” shadowboxing without a visualised opponent is just arm wavingVary your rhythm â€” not every combination at the same pace. Lull them with slow jabs, explode with the cross-kick.MONTH 4+ â€” GYM AND WRESTLING[ Find a Gym Â· Live Training Begins ]Finding a Gym in NigeriaSearch: Muay Thai gym [your city], Boxing gym [your city], MMA gym [your city]Boxing gyms are most common in Nigeria and an excellent alternative â€” the footwork, punching, and conditioning transfers directlyVisit before joining â€” watch a class, speak to the trainer, observe the culture. A good gym has discipline, structure, and respectful students.Training frequency: 3 times per week minimum once you find a gym. Anything less and progress is very slow.The moment you step into a gym and spar for the first time â€” everything changes. You will discover what actually works under pressure versus what only works in a mirror.Wrestling Foundations â€” What to Learn FirstYou do not need to become a wrestler. You need to understand enough to not be controlled on the ground and to control the clinch. These are the only wrestling concepts needed for your goals:Level 1 â€” Takedown DefenceSprawl: when someone shoots for your legs, immediately shoot your hips backward and drive your weight onto their upper back. This stuffs the takedown.Your hips go back and down â€” their head goes to the floorFrom there: establish a rear clinch or disengage and return to striking rangeLevel 2 â€” Clinch ControlInside position: get your arms inside your opponent's and control their biceps â€” this negates their clinch gameArm drag: pull one of their arms across their body â€” this exposes their back and creates takedown opportunity or disengagementLevel 3 â€” Getting UpIf taken down: immediately turn to your side (do not stay flat on your back)Use your elbow and knee to create a base, post your foot, stand up in base (one foot forward, one back, weight balanced)Stand up in base â€” not by just pushing up and leaving your back exposedTHE AURA CONNECTIONThe aura martial arts builds is not mystical. It comes from having been hit and continuing. From knowing you can handle physical confrontation. That knowing changes everything about how you carry yourself.The composure you are building in your Winter Arc â€” the deliberate stillness, the composed aura, the presence before words â€” is accelerated by martial arts training because:You learn that most physical confrontation is psychological before it is physical. The person who appears unafraid changes the dynamic before anything happens.Getting hit in controlled sparring and continuing builds a specific kind of confidence that no other training replicates. You stop fearing physical discomfort.The discipline of showing up and drilling the same techniques hundreds of times trains your brain to operate in a calm, focused state under pressure. This transfers everywhere.Your physical presence changes â€” the way you walk, stand, make eye contact, and respond to social pressure all shift when you have trained regularly.This is not about being able to fight. It is about being someone who has nothing to prove because they know themselves completely.Daily Martial Arts Practice â€” Your ScheduleDayActivityFocusMon/Wed/FriShadowboxing - 4 rounds x 3 minutesCombinations, footwork, flowTuesdayTechnique drilling - 200 reps of ONE techniquePerfect repetitionThursdayKick drills - 100 kicks each sideHip rotation, flexibility payoffSaturdayFull session - shadowboxing + drilling + reviewLongest martial arts sessionSundayVisualisation only - no physicalMental rehearsal, technique review
