ANTIGRAVITY AIWORKOUT PAGE â€” BUILD PROMPTAdd to existing EPÂ·OS web app Â· Next.js Â· Supabase Â· PrismaTHE TASKAdd a Workout page (/workout) to the existing EPÂ·OS personal development web app. The data file workout-plan-v2.md contains the complete 3-month workout plan in structured JSON format. Build this page to match the existing app design system exactly.Do NOT change any existing pages, components, navigation, or styling. This is an additive task only â€” add the workout page and integrate it into the existing sidebar navigation.DATABASEAdd This Table to prisma/schema.prismamodel WorkoutLog {  id           String   @id @default(cuid())  userId       String  date         DateTime @db.Date  exerciseId   String  completed    Boolean  @default(false)  month        Int  week         Int  user User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])  @@unique([userId, date, exerciseId])}After adding â€” run: npx prisma migrate dev --name add_workout_logPAGE STRUCTUREFile: app/(dashboard)/workout/page.tsxThis is a client component due to interactive state (day selection, month selection, checkbox toggling).Layout â€” Top to BottomMonth Selector â€” 3 pill buttons: Month 1 | Month 2 | Month 3. Active month is gold-filled. Controls which plan is displayed.Day Tabs â€” MON TUE WED THU FRI SAT SUN. Same style as existing day tabs in the Schedule page. Active day highlighted. Completed days show a small gold checkmark badge.Session Header â€” Day theme name, estimated duration, color accent bar matching the day's theme color from the data file.Progress Bar â€” 'X / Y exercises complete' with animated gold progress bar. Updates in real-time as checkboxes are ticked.Universal Components â€” Warm Up card and Daily Flexibility card always shown at top of every training day. Rest days show only the Daily Flexibility card.Blocks â€” render each block from the day's blocks array. Block header shows block name, rounds, rest between rounds. Then exercises inside.Cool Down card â€” always shown at bottom of every training day.EXERCISE CARD COMPONENTEach exercise renders as a card with this structure:Card LayoutTOP: Left side â€” exercise name (Bebas Neue, large). Right side â€” difficulty badge (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced) and category badge (push/pull/legs/core/skill/mobility etc.)MIDDLE ROW: Sets | Reps or Duration | Rest â€” displayed as three small stat chipsCHECKBOX: Large, touch-friendly (min 44px) gold checkbox on the right. On check â€” exercise name gets a strikethrough animation and the card gets a subtle green tint.EXPANDABLE SECTION 1: 'How to do it' â€” collapsed by default. Click to expand. Shows the full how-to text from the data.EXPANDABLE SECTION 2: 'Form cues' â€” collapsed by default. Shows bullet list of form cues.TIP BAR: Always visible at the bottom of the card. Gold left border, italic text. Shows the tip from the data.Card InteractionsCheckbox toggle: immediate optimistic UI update, then POST to /api/workout to save to DBExpand/collapse: smooth height animation using Framer Motion AnimatePresenceHover: card border brightens to category colorCompleted card: subtle green left border + strikethrough on name + reduced opacity on contentWeek A / Week B (Monday Only)Monday's push block has two alternating exercise sets. Add a small toggle above the push block: 'Week A | Week B'. Default to Week A. The toggle switches which exercise set is shown. Save the current week selection to localStorage so it persists.COMPLETION EXPERIENCEWhen All Exercises Are CheckedTrigger a completion state on the day view:Confetti animation (canvas-confetti library â€” already in the project if used for habits)Full-width completion banner appears below the progress bar: gold background, dark textMessage: 'Session complete. Rest. Recover. Come back stronger.'The day tab gets a permanent gold checkmark badgeCompletion is saved to DB â€” the checkmark persists across sessionsAPI ROUTEFile: app/api/workout/route.tsGET /api/workout?date=YYYY-MM-DD&month=1 â€” fetch all workout logs for a specific date and month for the authenticated user.POST /api/workout â€” body: { exerciseId, date, month, week, completed }. Creates or updates a workout log entry. Uses upsert on the unique constraint.Both routes must verify the authenticated user via Supabase session before any DB operation.SIDEBAR INTEGRATIONAdd the Workout page to the existing sidebar navigation:Icon: dumbbell or lightning bolt from Lucide ReactLabel: WorkoutPosition: under Physical section or between Habits and CoursesActive state: same gold left border and gold text as other active nav itemsMobile bottom tab: add to the 'More' section or replace one of the less-used tabsDESIGN SYSTEM â€” DO NOT DEVIATEMatch the existing app exactly. Do not introduce new design patterns.Colors: use existing CSS variables from the app â€” --gold, --blue, --purple, --green, --red, --teal, --bg-surface, --border, --text, --text-mutedTypography: Bebas Neue for exercise names and block headers. JetBrains Mono for sets/reps/duration stats. Crimson Pro italic for tips.Cards: same dark background, 1px border, 2px top accent bar, same border-radius as existing cardsProgress bar: same gold fill, same 3px height as habit tracker barsAnimations: Framer Motion with same easing and duration as existing page transitionsCheckboxes: match the style of the habit tracker checkboxes exactlyDATA LOADINGThe workout data (exercises, blocks, structure) is static â€” import directly from a TypeScript data file, not from the database. The database only stores completion states (which exercises are checked).On page load: fetch today's workout logs from /api/workout. Merge with the static exercise data to show which exercises are already completed. This pattern is the same as the course topic tracker.MOBILE REQUIREMENTSCards stack to full width on mobileCheckbox minimum tap target: 44pxExpandable sections use smooth accordion animation â€” no layout shiftDay tabs scroll horizontally if they do not fit on small screensMonth selector stays visible above the day tabs at all timesProgress bar is sticky at the top on mobile â€” always visible as user scrolls through exercisesWHAT NOT TO DODo NOT change the existing sidebar, navigation, or any other pageDo NOT introduce new color variables or fonts not already in the appDo NOT store the exercise data in the database â€” it is staticDo NOT use localStorage for completion states â€” these must persist in the databaseDo NOT use tables for layout â€” use CSS Grid and FlexboxDo NOT add a search or filter feature â€” this is a structured plan, not a librarySUMMARYBuild the workout page the way Emmanuel trains â€” with full intentionality, no wasted elements, and a result that looks like it was built specifically for this person.
