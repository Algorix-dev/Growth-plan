EMMANUEL PETERTRADING MASTERY ROADMAPSmart Money Concepts Â· ICT Framework Â· Risk DisciplineTHE TRADING PHILOSOPHYYou cannot remove loss. You can control it until your wins make it irrelevant.Trading is not about being right. It is about being disciplined when you are wrong and capitalising fully when you are right. Every professional trader loses. The difference between professionals and amateurs is not win rate â€” it is risk management, emotional control, and consistency of process.You are learning ICT (Inner Circle Trader) concepts and SMC (Smart Money Concepts) through Rayner Teo and TJR. This is an excellent foundation. ICT methodology is one of the most complete frameworks for understanding how institutional money moves markets. The path below is designed specifically around what you have already started.PHASE 1 â€” FOUNDATION[ Months 1â€“3 Â· Demo Account Only Â· No Real Money ]What ICT and SMC Are Actually Teaching YouBefore drilling techniques, understand the core philosophy behind everything ICT teaches:Banks and institutions move markets â€” not retail traders. They need liquidity (your stop losses) to fill their massive orders.Price does not move randomly. It moves to collect liquidity, mitigate imbalances, and deliver to target levels.Your job is to identify WHERE institutions are likely to buy or sell â€” and position yourself WITH them, not against them.Every concept you will learn is an expression of one thing: institutional order flow. Keep that in mind always.Core Concepts to Master â€” In This Exact Order1. Market StructureThis is the single most important concept. Everything else is built on top of it. You must understand this completely before moving to anything else.Higher Highs (HH) and Higher Lows (HL) = uptrend â€” price is being delivered higherLower Highs (LH) and Lower Lows (LL) = downtrend â€” price is being delivered lowerBreak of Structure (BOS) â€” when price breaks a previous significant high or low, confirming trend continuationChange of Character (ChoCH) â€” when price breaks structure in the OPPOSITE direction, signaling a potential reversalPractice: Open any chart. Mark every swing high and swing low. Draw the BOS and ChoCH. Do this for 30 minutes every day for two weeks until you can identify structure instantly without thinking.From TJR: Structure tells you the story. Everything else tells you the entry.2. LiquidityThis is the concept most retail traders never understand â€” and why they consistently get stopped out.Equal Highs (EQH) â€” multiple touches of the same price level = liquidity pool above. Institutions will sweep this before moving down.Equal Lows (EQL) â€” multiple touches of the same low = liquidity pool below. Institutions sweep this before moving up.Stop hunts â€” when price spikes beyond a level briefly then reverses hard. This is NOT random. It is institutions collecting the retail stops placed there.Swing highs and lows â€” obvious turning points on the chart are where retail traders place stops. That is where institutions hunt first.Practice: On any chart, circle every area where stops are likely resting. Then watch what happens when price approaches those areas.3. Order Blocks (OB)The most important entry concept in ICT methodology.A bullish order block is the last bearish (down) candle before a strong move up â€” institutions placed buy orders here and will defend this level on a return.A bearish order block is the last bullish (up) candle before a strong move down â€” institutions placed sell orders here.The key: an order block only becomes valid when price moves STRONGLY away from it, leaving an imbalance. A weak move from an OB means institutions were not heavily positioned there.Mitigation â€” when price returns to an OB to allow late institutional positioning before continuing in the original direction.Practice: Mark order blocks on a higher timeframe (4H or daily). Then drop to lower timeframes (15M or 5M) to find precise entries when price returns to mitigate the OB.4. Fair Value Gaps (FVG) / ImbalancesA Fair Value Gap is a 3-candle formation where the middle candle moves so fast that it leaves a gap â€” price moved too far too fast and left an imbalance.Bullish FVG: gap between the high of candle 1 and the low of candle 3 when candle 2 is strongly bullish.Bearish FVG: gap between the low of candle 1 and the high of candle 3 when candle 2 is strongly bearish.Price almost always returns to fill (mitigate) FVGs before continuing. This is where you look for entries.FVGs and Order Blocks often overlap. When they do â€” that confluence is one of your highest-probability entry zones.5. Premium and DiscountDiscount zone â€” the lower 50% of any price range. Institutions BUY in discount.Premium zone â€” the upper 50% of any price range. Institutions SELL in premium.Simple rule from Rayner Teo: buy in discount (below the 50% level of a range), sell in premium (above the 50% level). Never buy when price is already at the top of a range.Use the Fibonacci tool â€” set to 0 and 1 on a swing. The 0.5 level is your equilibrium. Below is discount, above is premium.6. Multi-Timeframe Analysis (MTFA)This is what separates consistently profitable traders from breakeven traders. Most beginners look at one timeframe. Professionals look at three.TimeframePurposeWhat You're Looking For4H or DailyBias â€” overall directionTrend, major OBs, key liquidity levels1HZone â€” where to look for entryRefined OBs, FVGs, BOS confirmation5M or 15MTrigger â€” precise entry timingEntry candle, SL placement, confirmationRule: NEVER enter a trade on a lower timeframe if the higher timeframe bias is against you. Higher timeframe always wins.PHASE 2 â€” STRATEGY CONSTRUCTION[ Months 3â€“6 Â· Still Demo Â· Build Your Edge ]Your Core Strategy â€” The SMC Confluence EntryThis is the strategy you are building toward. Every concept from Phase 1 combines here. A setup only qualifies when ALL conditions align.Entry Checklist â€” All 7 Must Be TrueHigher timeframe bias confirmed â€” you know the overall direction (bullish or bearish)Price is in a discount zone (for buys) or premium zone (for sells)A valid Order Block is identified on the 1H or higher timeframeFVG is present in the same zone (confluence)Liquidity has been swept â€” the stop hunt has occurred before your entryBOS on the lower timeframe confirms entry directionRisk:Reward is minimum 1:2 â€” ideally 1:3 or higherIf even one of these is missing â€” you do not enter. The discipline of waiting for full confluence is what separates this strategy from gambling.Risk Management â€” The Rules You Never BreakAmateurs focus on how much they can win. Professionals focus on how much they can lose.The Non-Negotiable Risk RulesMaximum 1% of account per trade â€” NEVER exceed this. Ever. 1% means if your account is $1000, maximum loss per trade is $10.Maximum 2 open trades at once â€” correlation between pairs means you can be in 2 trades that are essentially the same trade.Daily loss limit: 3% â€” if you lose 3% in one day, you stop trading that day. No exceptions. Come back tomorrow.Weekly loss limit: 5% â€” if you hit 5% loss in a week, stop for the rest of the week. Review your trades. Find what went wrong.Risk:Reward minimum 1:2 â€” you must stand to make at least twice what you risk. This means even at 40% win rate you are profitable.Stop loss is set BEFORE entry â€” not after. If you do not know where your stop loss goes, you do not have a trade.Never move stop loss against you â€” moving a stop further away to avoid being stopped out is how accounts get wiped.Never average down â€” if a trade is going against you, do not add to a losing position.Position Sizing FormulaUse this formula for every single trade. No exceptions.Position Size = (Account Size x Risk %) / (Entry Price - Stop Loss Price)Example: $1000 account, 1% risk, entry at 1.0850, SL at 1.0820 (30 pips)Risk amount = $1000 x 0.01 = $1030 pips stop x $1 per pip (micro lot) = $3 per lotPosition = $10 / $3 = 3.33 micro lots -- round to 3 micro lotsPHASE 3 â€” PSYCHOLOGICAL EDGE[ Ongoing Â· The War Inside ]The Emotional FrameworkTrading psychology is 80% of trading. Most people with good strategies still lose because of this layer. Given that you are working on composure, emotional control, and presence in your Winter Arc â€” this connects directly to who you are building yourself to be.The 6 Emotions That Destroy TradersFOMO (Fear of Missing Out) â€” entering a trade because it is moving fast and you do not want to miss it. There is always another setup. Missing one trade is irrelevant over 1000 trades.Revenge trading â€” after a loss, immediately entering another trade to recover. This is when the worst decisions are made. The market does not owe you recovery.Greed â€” not taking profit at your target because you want more. Move target or trail stop after 1:2 is hit â€” do not abandon your plan.Hope â€” holding a losing trade past your stop loss because you hope it will come back. Hope is not a strategy. Your stop loss is your strategy.Overconfidence â€” after a winning streak, increasing risk beyond your rules. A winning streak ends. Your risk rules do not change based on recent results.Fear â€” not entering a valid setup because of a recent loss. If all 7 checklist items are met â€” you enter. Fear is not one of the 7 items.The Composure Protocol â€” Pre-TradeBefore any trading session â€” do this. Every time.Review yesterday's trades in the journal â€” what worked, what did notCheck your emotional state â€” are you calm, neutral, focused? If angry, tired, or distracted â€” do not trade todayMark your key levels on the chart BEFORE the session opensSet your alerts â€” let the market come to you, do not watch every tickRemind yourself: no single trade matters. Process matters.LEARNING ROADMAP[ What to Watch Â· In What Order ]From Your Current SourcesICT (Inner Circle Trader) â€” YouTubeICT's content is extremely deep.
